The viewmodel proxies all enumerable property of the original model with the following behavior:\n *  - as long as no new value has been assigned to the viewmodel property, the original property will be returned.\n *  - any future change in the model will be visible in the viewmodel as well unless the viewmodel property was dirty at the time of the attempted change.\n *  - once a new value has been assigned to a property of the viewmodel, that value will be returned during a read of that property in the future. However, the original model remain untouched until `submit()` is called.\n *\n * The viewmodel exposes the following additional methods, besides all the enumerable properties of the model:\n * - `submit()`: copies all the values of the viewmodel to the model and resets the state\n * - `reset()`: resets the state of the viewmodel, abandoning all local modifications\n * - `resetProperty(propName)`: resets the specified property of the viewmodel\n * - `isDirty`: observable property indicating if the viewModel contains any modifications\n * - `isPropertyDirty(propName)`: returns true if the specified property is dirty\n * - `model`: The original model object for which this viewModel was created\n *\n * You may use observable arrays, maps and objects with `createViewModel` but keep in mind to assign fresh instances of those to the viewmodel's properties, otherwise you would end up modifying the properties of the original model.\n * Note that if you read a non-dirty property, viewmodel only proxies the read to the model.
